# scouttrek-dynamic-api

NodeJS and Express server that dynamically generates a GraphQL schema for a troop based on the scouting event types, and the custom event types. 

Tech stack:
* Apollo Server
* Mongoose + Atlas MongoDB Database
* Google Cloud App Engine

(Custom event types not yet active, therefore the GraphQL schema is complete but temporarily static. When the web console for ScoutTrek is active I will update the dynamic GraphQL schema.)
